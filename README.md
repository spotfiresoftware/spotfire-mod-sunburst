# Sunburst Chart Mod for TIBCO Spotfire®

<img src="assets/sunburst.png" width="60%"/>

Visualize hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles. A segment of the inner circle bears a hierarchical relationship to those segments of the outer circle which lie within the angular sweep of the parent segment.
A sunburst chart without any hierarchical data (one level of categories), looks similar to a donut chart. However, a sunburst chart with multiple levels of categories shows how the outer rings relate to the inner rings.
